## Hello!


I'm an Assistant Teaching Professor in Computer Science at Tufts University, which means I think too much about *how* and *why* we teach computing. Specifically, how do we make computing education more human-centered and foster self-regulated learning skills? 

I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science at North Carolina State University, with a focus in computing education research. My dissertation work investigated how novice programmers interact and learn from help-seeking resources outside the classroom (e.g. StackOverflow, API documentation, ChatGPT). I've also done some research in machine learning education, as well as designed courses and advised projects relating to sound and music computing. I can't formally advise any research, but any of this sounds interesting to you, I'd love to chat! 

Outside of teaching, I'm a music nerd and will always accept unsolicited music reccomendations. I also dabble a bit in audio production. I also enjoy playing TTRPGs, such as D&D and Lancer.
